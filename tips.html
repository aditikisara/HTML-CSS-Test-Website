            <h2>CURRY LEAVES</h2>
            <p>
                These leaves are a staple in most Indian dishes and are usually used very early on in the dish to maximize 
                flavor intensity.

                <br><br>
                
                The easiest way to grow curry leaves is to take a stem that’s about 3 inches long from an existing plant and 
                plant it in soil filled with many minerals and nutrients. We recommend using Miracle Grow as a fertilizer, 
                which helps the growing process speed up.

                <br><br>
                
                Place it in a sunny or a partially sunny area and water frequently.

                <br><br>
                
                Curry leaves have an aromatic smell and can be used in a variety of soups, sauces, and curries.

            <h2>EGGPLANT</h2>
            <p>
                Eggplants generally need a warmer environment to grow in, so summers are your best chance. When planting 
                the seeds, make sure they are a couple centimeters apart. It’s best to keep the soil moist, especially in 
                the first few stages of growth.
                
                <br><br>

                Make sure you harvest them by the time they’re mature. They will decrease in quality the older they get. 
                Smaller eggplants are more tender, while larger ones are more firm.

                <br><br>

                When harvesting, use scissors to cut them off to avoid damaging the plant.

        <div class= "col right">
            <h2>TOMATOES</h2>
            <p>
                There are many different kinds of tomatoes that can be grown. If you are using seeds from other tomatoes, 
                make sure they are dry and grown 6 - 8 weeks before you transplant them.

                <br><br>

                It’s best to plant them in warmer temperatures with a lot of sun. They can be pretty delicate, so make sure 
                you keep them away from heavy winds. You can keep tomatoes off the ground by staking them, which can be done 
                by using a stick and some string to hold the plant upright. 
                
                <br><br>

                They require a lot of water, so having soil with organic minerals, or other materials that help soak water 
                would be better.

            <h2>LYCHEES</h2>
            <p>
                Lychees are pretty rare in the USA, and they can only grow in certain zones. They take a couple years to grow 
                and cannot ripen further when harvested.

                <br><br>

                These plants can be knocked over by strong winds, so make sure you protect them from that. Water them regularly 
                and make sure the water isn’t flooding the area for too long.
