            <h2>TOMATOES</h2>
            <p>
                Tomatoes are one of the most common plants people grow in their gardens. It is a wonderful base for many soups 
                and stews. When they get closer to harvesting time, they can get really heavy for their branches. As a result, 
                many people stake their tomato plants to keep them upright.

                <br><br>

                They are normally grown in warmer climates and will die annually in colder weather. The plant is covered with 
                tiny hairs which will act as roots if it ever touches the ground.

            <h2>LYCHEES</h2>
            <p>
                These sweet fruits are mainly grown in Southeast Asia and India. It’s a fruit that has a red, bumpy outer 
                skin and a white, translucent, sweet inside with a single seed. They don’t need much attention as long as 
                they have a lot of moisture around the roots. The trees grow within a couple of years.

                <br><br>

                It’s important to eat only the lychees that have ripened (ripe ones have a red outer shell). Eating them 
                before ripening can be dangerous.
